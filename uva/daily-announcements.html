## Registration status
- The capacity for the 9 am lecture has increased to 170 spots
  - As of last night, 34 were still available
- Two labs (5:00 pm and 6:30 pm) have their capacity increased to 66
  - And the rooms changed -- they are both in Olsson 009 now
  - As of last night, 33 total lab spots were available
- No new spots will be created unless all the lab sections completely fill up
- So if you need to get into the class, you will have to choose the 9 am lecture and one of those two lab sections...
- If you register late, please submit a support request when you are able to, and we will give you an extension on the parts of lab 1
  - It may take a day or two for you to be able to use the course tools
