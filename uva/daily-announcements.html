## Midterm procedure
- This is the procedure for both midterms this semester
- It is taken during your normal lab section
- The first rule of 2150 midterm is that you don't speak about 2150 midterm
  - Translation: it is an honor violation to speak about it to somebody who has not taken it yet
- You have to fill out the bubble footer at the bottom of the first page of the exam
  - And put your name and UVa userid at the top of each page
  - And sign the honor pledge
- We hope to have it graded next Monday evening. (Normally this would be faster but faculty have a conference to go to).
- There will not be office hours the Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday of a midterm week
- No lab this week due to this.
- Many questions will have a "word limit"...

## Anonymous Feedback Fun
- "Why are we being made to go through an unnecessary amount of github files? It's not like we're learning how to use github from this. It's easy to set up github pages as a website and just make this a proper webpage. It might be worth one person's additional effort because it would save ~600+ people a good amount of time per semester. I would even volunteer helping set up a proper website using github pages if you want, similar to the one they have for 2102. Just ask in class, I'm sure a bunch of students know how github pages works."
